need install gradlew first, can not checkin the binary due to the G3 limitation
To build the xmldumper run the gradlew command, currently works on gradle 6.5
gradle wrapper
./gradlew assembleDebug

it will generate the following apk
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

manually copy and rename to uicd-xmldumper-server-xxxx.apk and
uicd-xmldumper-server-test-xxxx.apk


It also supports blaze build now:
blaze build -- java/com/google/uicd/xmldumper:xmldumper
